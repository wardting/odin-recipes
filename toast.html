    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Burnt toast is the perfect health food, and it tastes <em>great</em>. It is perfectly delightful on it's own but why not smother it in your favourite
    fish paste for that extra health kick.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 slice of bread</li>
        <li>fish paste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn the toaster to its highest setting and gently place the slice of bread into the toaster. Push the lever down and make yourself a cup of tea.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Hopefully your smoke alarm has gone off by now, which is a good indication that your toast is ready. If your toast has popped up and the alarm hasn't gone off
            then consider putting the toast down again.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Once you've turned the smoke alarm off using the end of a broom, open the windows. Grab a metal fork and using a strong jabbing motion, remove the
            toast from the toaster. 
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Smother the charcoal with fish paste, if that is to your liking, otherwise just eat bone dry for that extra
            delicious crunch.
        </li>
    </ol>
